# Linux suitability
A simple self-check list for checking whether Linux is suitable to you.

## Introduction
As an open-source promoter, I think we should practice the open-source spirit in our daily life. __, the OS of computer is a good place to do it, and I also continously encourage my friends to use Linux instead.
But, there are still some jobs need certain OS, and now GNU/Linux can't satisfy the requirements, so I design this check list to let people make decision according to the result.

## Technology
- React: 18.2.0
- Node.js: 19.7.0
- `npm` : 9.6.1
